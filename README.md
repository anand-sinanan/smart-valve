# smart-valve

This is pretty much me playing around with UIKit and barebones Vanilla style HTML5/CSS3/Javascript.

Theme : Using IoT to manage your water consumption (concept)

The core of the idea is the use of an electronic valve device (possibly connected to an Arduino board hosting other data collecting sensors), whether for home or commercial use, being remotely and/or automatically managed. The goal specific to this concept would be efficiently watering the lawn, saving you time and $$$ on water consumption. The long term goal is that this represents any IoT device whose data can be used to analyze and suggest efficiences, ultimately reducing consumption costs and carbon footprint.
